# Getting Started with Ethical Hacking: A Beginner's Guide

## Introduction

Ethical hacking, also known as penetration testing, is the practice of testing
a computer system, network, or web application to identify vulnerabilities
that could be exploited by attackers.

---

## Prerequisites

Before diving into tools, you need a solid foundation in:

### 🕸 Networking  
Understanding IP addresses, subnetting, the OSI model, and common protocols (TCP, UDP, HTTP).

### 🐧 Linux  
Get comfortable using the terminal, file system, permissions, and package managers.

### 🧪 Scripting  
Basic knowledge of **Python** or **Bash** helps automate tasks and build simple tools.

---

## Essential Tools

Here are the industry-standard tools every ethical hacker should know:

### 🔍 Nmap  
For network discovery and security auditing.

### 🎯 Metasploit  
A powerful framework for developing and executing exploit code.

### 📡 Wireshark  
For capturing and analyzing network traffic in real time.

### 🕵️ Burp Suite  
Used for web application security testing, including interception, fuzzing, and scanning.

## The Golden Rule  

> **"With great power comes great responsibility."**

Never scan, probe, or attack any system without **explicit, written permission**.  
Unauthorized hacking is illegal and unethical.

---

## Next Steps

1. Set up a safe learning environment using **VirtualBox** or **VMware**.  
2. Install **Kali Linux** or **Parrot OS**.  
3. Practice ethically on legal platforms like:
   - TryHackMe  
   - Hack The Box  
   - PortSwigger Web Security Academy
