# The Hidden Dangers of IoT: How to Secure Your Smart Home

## The IoT Explosion

From smart bulbs to refrigerators, everything is connected.  
But unfortunately, security is often an afterthought for many manufacturers.

---

## Common Vulnerabilities

### 🔑 Default Passwords  
Many devices ship with `admin:admin` or similarly weak credentials that users never change.

### 🛑 Lack of Updates  
IoT firmware is rarely patched, leaving devices exposed for years.

### 📡 Insecure Communication  
Some devices still transmit data using **cleartext HTTP**, making them easy targets for interception.

## Hardening Your IoT Network

### 1. Network Segmentation  
Don’t put cheap IoT devices on the same Wi-Fi network as your laptop or sensitive data.  
Use a **Guest Network** or a **separate VLAN** for IoT devices.

### 2. Change Default Credentials  
Always change the default username and password immediately after installing a new device.

### 3. Disable UPnP  
Universal Plug and Play allows devices to automatically open ports on your router.  
This is a major security risk—disable it in your router settings.

## Example: Shodan Search

Search engines like **Shodan** scan the internet for exposed IoT devices.  
If your camera or smart device is misconfigured, it might be visible to the entire world.

## Example: Simple Port Scanner (Educational Only)

```python
# Pseudo-code for a simple port scanner (for educational use only)
import socket

target = "192.168.1.50"

def scan(port):
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    result = sock.connect_ex((target, port))
    if result == 0:
        print(f"Port {port} is Open")
    sock.close()
